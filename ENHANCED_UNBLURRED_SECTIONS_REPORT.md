**Cross-Checking Requirements**:
- Internal consistency across all sections
- Synchronization of peak patients and revenue
- Alignment of regulatory assessments with TAM projections
- Consistency of risk assessments with asset characteristics

### 4. Mathematical Accuracy

**Verification Requirements**:
- All calculations must be mathematically correct
- Growth rates must be defensible
- Assumptions must be specific and realistic
- TAM calculations must be verifiable
